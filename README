These codes implement the basic functionality of mnist in docker. After submitting a picture with 28*28 through curl or browser, tensorflow will recognize and return the recognition result on http://127.0.0.1:8081/file/<file_routine>.

The entire project is built on top of Python, using the flask for routing and storing it in a container for easy implementation. The stored model uses a convolutional neural network to implement mnist. 

The following are specific methods of use.

First use docker to download cassandra's image, then run docker build.
Require 

run by#docker run -d -p 8080:8080 -v /Users/a912158001/images:/images -v /Users/a912158001/model:/model
