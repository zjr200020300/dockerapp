These codes implement the basic functionality of mnist in docker. After submitting a picture with 28*28 through curl or browser, tensorflow will recognize and return the recognition result on http://127.0.0.1:8081/file/<file_routine>.

The entire project is built on top of Python, using the flask for routing and storing it in a container for easy implementation. The stored model uses a convolutional neural network to implement mnist. 

Require 
tensorflow 2.0.0
flask 1.1.1
cassandra-driver 3.22.0
Pillow 7.0.0
The following are specific method of use.

First, use docker to download cassandra's image.
 docker start zhang-cassandra
 docker run -it --network zhang-network --rm cassandra cqlsh zhang-cassandra
 use mykeyspace;
 Select * from mytable ;


Second, run ana-app by:
docker run -d -p 8081:8080 -v /Users/a912158001/images:/images -v /Users/a912158001/model:/model ana-app:1.0
then you could use the following link to use the app.
http://127.0.0.1:8081/file/<file_routine>


Finally,the data will be also stored in cassandra:
use mykeyspace;
Select * from mytable ;
